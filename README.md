This work explores the implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as a method to mitigate hallucinations in abstractive text summarization using transformer-based BART and T5. The research utilizes the HaDeS dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of RAG in improving the quality and factual consistency of generated summaries. Quantitative analysis shows that summaries generated with RAG consistently outperform those without RAG across various metrics, including ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore, and MoverScore. Notably, BART with RAG demonstrated a 21% improvement over its non-RAG counterpart, while T5 with RAG showed a 17.3% improvement. Additionally, the study adopts a two-step summarization technique that further enhances summary quality, leading to a cumulative improvement of 16.7% when combined with optimized retrieval processes by tuning the Top_k value. Despite these advancements, manual evaluation of hallucinations suggests that while BART with RAG excels in quantitative metrics, T5 with RAG may better manage hallucinations in certain contexts. The findings underscore the potential of RAG as a robust solution for enhancing abstractive summarization compared to other approaches on their own, while also highlighting areas for future research, including the refinement of retrieval processes and the application of these techniques to larger and more diverse datasets including long text summarisation.
